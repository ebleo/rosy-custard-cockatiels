## Computer Science
##### Some notes about hashing:
[**Hashing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function): a method of converting a key (string, number, piece of data,...) to a code of sorts.

![Example hash function](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Hash_table_4_1_1_0_0_1_0_LL.svg/240px-Hash_table_4_1_1_0_0_1_0_LL.svg.png)  
In the above function, there is a collision (red hash, "02") for "John Smith" and "Sandra Dee." There are only 15 possible hashes for this algorithm.

There are a finite number of hashes possible for a particular algorithm. The strength of an algorithm can be determined by:
- how easy/difficult it is to unhash/revert the string
- how many possible hashes there are (risk of collisions)
  - collision: when two string/files share the same hash

Example algorithm: the [md5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)  
Since the MD5 always returns a hash with a fixed byte amount, it is one way; the full information of the hashed object is not retained.  
- [r/eli5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/21szbj/eli5_how_can_a_hash_of_a_file_ie_an_md5_checksum/) -- an explanation from reddit
- another good explaination [here](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understanding-hash-functions-and-keeping-passwords-safe--net-17577) (the explanation is from a PHP pov)  

In order to create hashes that are harder to crack, you can add [salt][1]  

- Cool web book for [python][cs05]

#### Programming Paradigms
- [comparison of paradigms in python][cs04]
- [eli5 from r/learningprogramming ][cs01]
- [from r/ELI5][cs02]
- [functional programming vs object oriented][cs03]
  - **FP** must pass value to modify as well as data the values are associated with (if you have employee data, `[Bob, 1000.00]` then you have to pass the entire entry `[name, pay]`)
  - **OOP** can modify an attribute of an object with a method `Bob.promo = raise`
    - if the data has multiple attributes you can modify one by specifying an attribute vs accessing the entire entry of data
  - FP typically creates a copy we store in another variable--original data untouched!--whereas OOP modifies an attribute
    - can be complicated for OOP since values will change if attribute or method is called, whereas FP values remain same and we work with new variables going fwd

## Python Topics/Functions
[**`zip()`**][3]: takes two iterables (iterables meaning something that can be iterated over, like a list), goes through both taking and combining the *i*-th element of each and forms a tuple of *i*-th iterable. Repeats until end of shortest iterable is reached.  
*example* (from [here][2]):
```python
>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = [4, 5, 6]
>>> zipped = zip(x, y)
>>> list(zipped)
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
```  
The *i*-th element of each list `x , y` is present since both lists are the same length.

Note: kind of like dot product but not really--similar in the combining the *i*-th element, but not much else.

[`repr()`][4]: There are [multiple methods of printing][5] to the console; while `print()` and `write()` give more human readable outputs, `repr()` gives output that can be read by an interpreter--it looks more like the output you would get after running a function in the command line  
*Note*: if you want multiple interpreter-like outputs, you'll have to print each one (so far as I know)
Example use of `repr()` [here][5]

[`try:`][pyf01]: A way to handle errors/exceptions  
```python
while True:
    try:
        x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again...")
```
> - First, the *try clause* (the statement(s) between the `try` and `except` keywords) is executed.
- If no exception occurs, the *except clause* is skipped and execution of the `try` statement is finished.
- If an exception occurs during execution of the try clause, the rest of the clause is skipped. Then if its type matches the exception named after the `except` keyword, the except clause is executed, and then execution continues after the `try` statement.
- If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the except clause, it is passed on to outer `try` statements; if no handler is found, it is an *unhandled exception* and execution stops with a message as shown above.

### Python Implementations
cpython, pypy, iron python...all different *implementations* of python using Python the *programming language*
- [good answer/explanation from stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17130975/python-vs-cpython)

### [plotly][plty01] (package)
-  super coolbeans plot-sy stuff


### scikit-learn
**`shape`**: attribute of matrices; shape => (n_samples, n_features) -- see [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)

### [Accessing a (SQL) Database][6]
This consists of two parts: **database driver** and **ORM** (Object-relational-mapping)
- Database Driver
  - looks like going with [PyMySQL](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL)
    - documentation [here](http://pymysql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - this would be a driver to interact with the db
  - another popular flavor of DBAPI [MySQLdb](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_1/dialects/mysql.html)
    - MySQL-Python in PyPI
    - [Installation](http://mysql-python.blogspot.com/2012/11/is-mysqldb-hard-to-install.html)
- [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
  - helps with seemingly incompatible datatypes
  - is a layer of abstraction
  - used with a database driver
  - s/o question [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2550292/purpose-of-sqlalchemy-over-mysqldb "a quick comparison of db drivers and ORM's")
### SQLAlchemy
- [`flush()` vs `commit()`](http://skien.cc/blog/2014/02/06/sqlalchemy-and-race-conditions-follow-up/)

### Using IPython
Note: always need to include a `!` (bang) when using commands eg `!pip install PyMySQL`
***
## SQL/mySQL
### [mySQL][sql1]
- Formatting
  - Files must be input with UTF-8 incoding (when loading in data)
    - Be sure to omit headers in data file(s)
  - Be sure to remove special characters in data, or reformat them

- Logging
  - [syslog][sql2] (have yet to figure out this one)
  - [General information][sql3]
  - How I've been going about it
    - have only had success with absolute paths
    - have not tried relative paths
  ``` sql
  tee DRIVE:/MYFOLDER/MYPATH/myloggingfile.txt
  ```
  No quotation marks are needed when giving the path.
- Linking
  - Useful to reduce redunancy (think hierarchal data)
  - [info][sql4]

## Data Science
### Machine Learning
#### Neural Networks
- [overview, self taught learning](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/selftaughtlearning/SelfTaughtLearning/)
- [eli5 explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/24k3sb/eli5_neural_networks/)
- [**Unsupervised**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning)
  - Doesn't have a target output, unlike *supervised*
  - Weight on variable to another
    - affect of features on each other's on/off status (assuming binary features)
- **Supervised**

#### [Simplest Explanation of SVM's. Ever.][7]
From r/MachineLearning (alternatively, there's [*this*][8]...)
We have 2 colors of balls on the table that we want to separate.

![Balls on a table](http://i.imgur.com/zDBbD.png)

We get a stick and put it on the table, this works pretty well right?

![Now a stick!](http://i.imgur.com/aLZlG.png)

Some villain comes and places more balls on the table, it kind of works but one of the balls is on the wrong side and there is probably a better place to put the stick now.

![baddie, oh no!](http://i.imgur.com/kxWgh.png)

SVMs try to put the stick in the best possible place by having as big a gap on either side of the stick as possible.

![gap trick](http://i.imgur.com/ePy4V.png)

Now when the villain returns the stick is still in a pretty good spot.

![villian returns](http://i.imgur.com/BWYYZ.png)

There is another trick in the SVM toolbox that is even more important. Say the villain has seen how good you are with a stick so he gives you a new challenge.

![a new challenge :O](http://i.imgur.com/R9967.png)

Thereâ€™s no stick in the world that will let you split those balls well, so what do you do? You flip the table of course! Throwing the balls into the air. Then, with your pro ninja skills, you grab a sheet of paper and slip it between the balls.

![table flipping time](http://i.imgur.com/WuxyO.png)

Now, looking at the balls from where the villain is standing, they balls will look split by some curvy line.

![and a curvy line...](http://i.imgur.com/gWdPX.png)

Boring adults the call 'balls' data, the 'stick' a classifier, the 'biggest gap trick' optimization, call 'flipping the table' kernelling and the piece of paper a hyperplane.

#### [A cool classifier comparison][14]
![Comparison Table][classtable]
Classification accuracy shown in bottom right of each plot.

#### Random Forests
- [Read this][19]
- Basically:
  1. Divvy up data
  1. Grow a tree for each part/chunk of data
  1. Each tree gets a vote on feature importance (1 tree, 1 vote--or something similar)
- *alternatively*, read [this][20]
  - uses a friend/movie recommendation analogy


### Quick notes

#### [Multiclass Classifiers][13]
Simply put: when classifying into on of more than 2 classes. Classification into one of 2 classes would be *binary* classification.

#### [Instance Based Learning][15]
Instance based learning relies on comparing new problems with instances seen in training, rather than focusing explicitly on generalisation.

#### Notes on the titanic excercise/decision trees:  
Decision trees don't replicate the portions of categories that each entry falls into (like a certain amount o men vs. women surviving), they simply *make decisions* based on those factors as a sort of split point.
- *Example*: The titanic decision tree says 67% to 23% female to male split--that doesn't mean that of the predicted females/males of a test data set would get that same survival ratio, it's just reflecting what the training indicates. It's a *tool for visualisation*, **not** the prediction itself. You just keep going along the splits based on where you fall, and the percentages show previously indicated likelihoods.

#### [Multiple testing][16]
Looking for testing multiple effects at once

#### Misc terms
- **hypothesis space**: set of all hyp, that may be returned by ML alg
